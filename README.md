About
-----------------
Organizing data into a searchable data resource about empowered female and non-binary representation in media. The goal of this project is to contribute to the ongoing efforts that define, review and drive for increased representation and imagery as well as give a space for others in the community to participate. You do not have to be technical to participate in this project. That is the beauty of media. 

What stories and characters inspire you that you think should be on this list/in the dataset? What criteria should we use? How should it be measured?

Building using Google Cloud Platform since I work there and I have access to resources.
